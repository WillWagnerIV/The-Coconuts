Description: # UPTS - Unified Player Tracking System
        
        This is a simple Proof Of Concept for an internal developer tool for tracking and working with player, game and user data in Python.  The application allows a developer group to input and output to and fram a MySQL database as well as reading to and from json files.  It has integrated support for Pandas and Numpy, making it an ideal tool to work with other data science modules.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        You will need a combination of the following...
        
        Either iPython (includes Python 3.7, Pandas and Numpy)
        ```
        pip install ipython
        ```
        or install them individually
        ```
        pip install python3.7
        pip install pandas
        pip install numpy
        ```
        Then install the following:
        ```
        pip install requests
        pip install mysql
        pip install mysql-connector
        ```
        
        
        ## Installation Instructions
        
        *testPyPi erases its content without warning to create space for new test projects.*
        
        If there are any errors with testPyPi, please use the tar package instructions.
        
        ### testPyPi Installation ( Easiest )
        
        You can use pip to install from TestPyPI:
        
        1.) Activate your virtual env (for example):
        
            env/bin/activate
        
        2.) cd to your working directory.
        
            cd path/to/awesomeness
        
        3.) Install with the following command:
        
            pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/ answer_pkg_ex
        
        ### tar Package Installation
        
        1.) You can download the tar archive here:
        
          <Fix this URL>
        
        2.) copy the downloaded tar to your working directory
        
        3.) cd to your working directory.
        
            cd path/to/awesomeness
        
        4.) Activate your virtual env
        
            env/bin/activate
        
        5.) use pip to install the archive.  The following is example code.  Please change the version to match your download.
        
            pip install python3 -m pip install UPTS.tar.gz
        
        ## Test Installation
        
        You can test that it was installed correctly by running it from your Python interpreter.
        
        Start your Python interpreter (make sure you are still in your virtualenv if you are using one):
        
            ```
            ipython
            ```
        
        And then simply run *upts_main*.
            ```
            run upts_main.py
            ```
        
        ## Running the tests
        
        To run the tests, you will need to install pyTest and optionally pytest-coverage
        ```
        pip install pytest
        pip install pytest-cov
        ```
        
        To run the accompanying tests with coverage, you can execute the following code from the UPTS folder.
        ```
        pytest -s -v --cov=src tests/test_upts.py
        ```
        
        
        ## Deployment
        
        For purposes of the class project, we have deployed a MySQL server that will be accessed by this program.  This server is not secure and no personal information should be stored on the server.  The default server may be shut down at any point by CGU.  
        
        Any further deployment would require a MySQL or equivalent database server running either locally or remotely.  This would need to be set up prior to using the program.
        
        The database variables at the beginning should be customized for your database.
