# UPTS - Unified Player Tracking System

This is a simple POC for an internal developer system for tracking and working with player, game and user data in Python.  The application allows a developer group to input and output to and fram a MySQL database as well as reading to and from json files.  It has integrated support for Pandas and Numpy, amking it an ideal tool to work with other data science modules.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

You will need a combination of the following:

```
pip install python3.7
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
or
pip install ipython (includes python 3.7, pandas, and numpy)


pip install requests
pip install mysql
pip install mysql-connector
```

### Installing

Currently working on the distribution - check back for Installation Details.

```
Example
```

And repeat

```

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Any deployment would require a MySQL or equivalent database server set up prior to using the program.

The database variables at the beginning should be customized for your database.
